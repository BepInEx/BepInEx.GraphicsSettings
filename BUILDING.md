# Building

You can build the project two ways: by using MSBuild-compatible IDE or the CakeBuild script.

## CakeBuild script

You can use the included [cakebuild](https://cakebuild.net/) script that allows you to automatically get dependencies, build and package everything.

**Make sure you have either [MSBuild (via Visual Studio Installer)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/) installed.**

### Windows (Command Line)

Clone or [download](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/archive/master.zip) this repository.  
After that, run

```bat
build.bat -target=Build
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

Clone or [download](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/archive/master.zip) this repository.  
After that, run

```ps
./build.ps1 -target=Build
```

Make sure you have the execution policy set to enable running scripts.

### Linux (Bash)

Clone or [download](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/archive/master.zip) this repository.  
After that, run

```sh
./build.sh --target=Build
```

### Additional build targets

The build script provides the following build targets (that you can pass via the `target` parameter)

| Target        | Description                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Build`       | Pulls dependencies and builds BepInEx                                    |
| `MakeDist`    | Runs `Build` and creates distributable packages into `bin/dist` folder   |
| `Pack`        | Runs `MakeDist` and zips everything into archives into `bin/dist` folder |

## MSBuild

Download and IDE (for example Visual Studio), open the solution file and build it.
